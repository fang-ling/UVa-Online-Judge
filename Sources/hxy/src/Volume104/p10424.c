/*
 * 10424 Love Calculator
 * One day I asked Saima that how much she loves me. Her answer was "71.43%". I
 * was surprised as well as shocked by her answer. I could not understand why
 * she didn't tell 100% and why she told a particular and peculiar fraction like
 * 71.43. Looking at my surprised, shocked and nervous face she burst out
 * laughing and told that she loves me more than any thing in this universe and
 * it was nothing but a silly and funny love calculation. Then she described me
 * the calculation. In this problem you will have to write a program so that any
 * one can calculate love between any two persons very quickly (of course a very
 * silly game).
 *
 * Rules: You will be given two names. These two names can have white space or
 * some other non-alphabetical characters like $ & % etc. But only the alphabets
 * from a to z or A to Z will participate in love calculation. Each alphabet has
 * a particular value. The values are from 1 to 26 in ascending order of the
 * alphabets. Itâ€™s like this, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ..., z = 26. Both upper case
 * and lower case holds the same values. Then make the sum of these numbers
 * until it comes in one digit. [For example, consider a name â€˜bczâ€™. Here,
 * b = 2, c = 3 and z = 26. So, the sum is (2+3+26) = 31 = (3+1) = 4.] Then the
 * ratio of these two numbers in percentage will be the result.
 *
 * Remember: Result can not be more than 100% . Take the ratio carefully to
 * avoid this problem.
 *
 * Input:
 * Your input will be two names. Each name holds not more than 25 characters.
 * End of file will indicate the end of input.
 *
 * Output:
 * For each pair of names your program will have to calculate the love between
 * those two persons and give the result as output. In result two digits to be
 * displayed after the decimal point. All the results must be in new lines.
 *
 * Solution:
 * Use two functions.
