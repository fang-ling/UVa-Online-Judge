 * 13025 Back to the Past
 *
 * Dr. James, the only PhD holder of our country in Competitive Programming
 * (CP), has recently joined the Department of Competitive Programming in
 * St. John Snow University as a professor. He has passed a lot of memorable
 * times in this institute as a student. He was a hero among the seniors and
 * juniors. He also loved to spend good times with others, taking voluntary
 * classes, helping students to learn different algorithms and data structures.
 *
 * "Alas! The good old time. I wish if I could go back to the past" â€” Professor
 * Dr. James mumbles. Though he is now a teacher in the institute, he cannot
 * maintain the previous interactions and activities with students. Dr. James
 * wants to be the man like before but some senior professors does not like this
 * attitude. They do not appreciate the friendly interaction between teacher and
 * student.
 *
 * Now Professor Dr. James dreams about going back to the past. As he knows that
 * this is not possible, he is just giving himself consolation seeing the
 * calendar.
 *
 * Suddenly Dr. James recalled today's date (31/10/2015) as the preliminary
 * contest of ACM ICPC Asia Regional Dhaka site 2015 is going to start on this
 * date. As he is one of the problem setters and judge, he wants to play a
 * (hard) game with the contestants. Name of the game is "Back to the Past".
 *
 * The rule of the game is simple. Professor Dr. James has chosen a random past
 * date. You have to print the date and the day of the week of that date. The
 * chosen date by Dr. James is 29/05/2013 (nobody knows the reason). See the
 * output section for more information.
 *
 * Input:
 * There is no input in this problem.
 *
 * Output:
 * Output the date and the name of the week day.
 *
 * Solution:
 * May 29, 2013 Wednesday
