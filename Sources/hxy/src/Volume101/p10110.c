/*
 * 10110 Light, more light
 *
 * There is man named "mabu" for switching on-off light in our University. He
 * switches on-off the lights in a corridor. Every bulb has its own toggle
 * switch. That is, if it is pressed then the bulb turns on. Another press will
 * turn it off. To save power consumption (or may be he is mad or something
 * else) he does a peculiar thing. If in a corridor there is n bulbs, he walks
 * along the corridor back and forth n times and in i-th walk he toggles only
 * the switches whose serial is divisable by i. He does not press any switch
 * when coming back to his initial position. A i-th walk is defined as going
 * down the corridor (while doing the peculiar thing) and coming back again. Now
 * you have to determine what is the final condition of the last bulb. Is it on
 * or off?
 *
 * Input:
 * The input will be an integer indicating the nâ€™th bulb in a corridor. Which is
 * less then or equals 2**32 - 1. A zero indicates the end of input. You should
 * not process this input.
 *
 * Output:
 * Output 'yes' if the light is on otherwise 'no', in a single line.
