/**
 * Checks a necessary condition for making forward progress.

 * Use this function to detect conditions that must prevent the program from
 * proceeding, even in shipping code.
 *
 * * In `-O0` builds (the default for Xcode's Debug configuration) and
 *   `ONLINE_JUDGE` symbol is not defined: If `condition` evaluates to `false`,
 *   stop program execution in a debuggable state after printing `message`.
 *
 * * In `-O2` builds (the default for Xcode's Release configuration) and
 *   `ONLINE_JUDGE` symbol is not defined: If `condition` evaluates to `false`,
 *   stop program execution after printing `message`.
 *
 * * In any builds with `ONLINE_JUDGE` symbol defined, `condition` is not
 *   evaluated. Failure to satisfy that assumption is a serious programming
 *   error.
 *
 * - Parameters:
 *   - condition: The condition to test. `condition` is not evaluated with
 *     `ONLINE_JUDGE` symbol defined.
 *   - message: A string to print if `condition` is evaluated to `false`.
