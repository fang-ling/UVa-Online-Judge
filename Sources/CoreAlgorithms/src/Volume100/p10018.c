 * 10018 Reverse and Add
 *
 * The "reverse and add" method is simple: choose a number, reverse its digits
 * and add it to the original. If the sum is not a palindrome (which means, it
 * is not the same number from left to right and right to left), repeat this
 * procedure.
 *                    195    Initial number
 *                    591
 *                    ---
 *                    786
 *                    678
 *                    ---
 *   For example:    1473
 *                   3741
 *                   ----
 *                   5214
 *                   4125
 *                   ----
 *                   9339    Resulting palindrome
 *
 * In this particular case the palindrome '9339' appeared after the 4th
 * addition. This method leads to palindromes in a few step for almost all of
 * the integers. But there are interesting exceptions. 196 is the first number
 * for which no palindrome has been found. It is not proven though, that there
 * is no such a palindrome.
 *
 * You must write a program that give the resulting palindrome and the number of
 * iterations (additions) to compute the palindrome.
 *
 * You might assume that all tests data on this problem:
 *   - will have an answer,
 *   - will be computable with less than 1000 iterations (additions),
 *   - will yield a palindrome that is not greater than 4,294,967,295.
 *
 * Input:
 * The first line will have a number N (0 < N â‰¤ 100) with the number of test
 * cases, the next N lines will have a number P to compute its palindrome.
 *
 * Output:
 * For each of the N tests you will have to write a line with the following
 * data: minimum number of iterations (additions) to get to the palindrome and
 * the resulting palindrome itself separated by one space.
