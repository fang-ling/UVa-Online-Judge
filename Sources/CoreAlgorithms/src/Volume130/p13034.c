 * 13034 Solve Everything :-)
 *
 * In recent ACM ICPC World Finals (2015), there were 13 problems and each of
 * those were solved by at least one team. Well, we will not discuss about how
 * it happened or who did that.
 *
 * In this contest, SIUPC'2015, we are expecting to have at most 128 teams
 * onsite. Three cheers for you for becoming one of the participating teams!
 *
 * Now, we will discuss what we wanted to prepare for you. From the World Finals
 * 2015, we are just inspired to have a set of 13 problems each of which can be
 * solved by at least one participating team.
 *
 * Luckily, we have come to know about an artificial intelligence system named
 * "PAUL". Given a set of problems, for each individual problem, it can foretell
 * the number of teams that are going to solve that problem.
 *
 * Now, we need your help. We are going to give you the predictions of PAUL for
 * some problemsets. For each of the problemsets (with 13 problems), we request
 * you to tell us whether we can consider the set so that each problem from that
 * set can be solved by at least one team.
 *
 * Input:
 * First line of input consists of an integer S (â‰¤ 23), the number of
 * problemsets with 13 problems. Each of next S lines consists of 13 space
 * separated integers, the predicted number of teams to solve each problem.
 *
 * Output:
 * For each problem set, output a line formatted as 'Set #N : Ans'. Here N is an
 * integer which is the serial number of set. And Ans is your answer which is
 * either 'Yes' or 'No' (without quotes).
