/**
 * A Unicode string value that is a collection of characters.
 *
 * A string is a series of characters, such as "`CoreAlgorithm`", that forms a
 * collection. Strings are Unicode correct and locale insensitive, and are
 * designed to be efficient.
 *
 * You can create new strings using ``string_init``, which accepts C string
 * literals as its parameter. A C _string literal_ is a series of characters
 * enclosed in quotes.
 *
 * ```objectivec
 * var greeting = string_init("Welcome!")
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * string_deinit(greeting) // Deallocates the object when it is no longer needed
 * ```
 *
 * Modifying and Comparing Strings
 * ===============================
 *
 * Strings always have reference semantics because they are implemented using
 * pointers.
 *
 * Comparing strings for equality using ``string_compare`` is always performed
 * using the UTF-32 representation of the strings. As a result, different
 * representations of a string are considered not equal. It is the caller's
 * responsibility to normalize the given C string.
 *
 * Accessing String Elements
 * =========================
 *
 * A string is a collection of _extended grapheme clusters_, which approximate
 * human-readable characters. Many individual characters, such as "√©", "ÍπÄ", and
 * "üáØüáµ", can be made up of multiple Unicode scalar values. These scalar values
 * are combined by Unicode's boundary algorithms into extended grapheme
 * clusters, represented by the `UInt32` type. Each element of a string is
 * represented by a `UInt32` value.
 *
 * ```objectivec
 * var cafe = string_init("Cafe üåç")
 *
 * printf("%u\n", string_get(cafe, 5))
 * // Prints 127757
 * ```
