 * 10055 Hashmat the brave warrior
 *
 * Hashmat is a brave warrior who with his group of young soldiers moves from
 * one place to another to fight against his opponents. Before Fighting he just
 * calculates one thing, the difference between his soldier number and the
 * opponent's soldier number. From this difference he decides whether to fight
 * or not. Hashmatâ€™s soldier number is never greater than his opponent.
 *
 * Input:
 * The input contains two numbers in every line. These two numbers in each line
 * denotes the number soldiers in Hashmat's army and his opponent's army or vice
 * versa. The input numbers are not greater than 2**32. Input is terminated by
 * 'End of File'.
 *
 * Output:
 * For each line of input, print the difference of number of soldiers between
 * Hashmat's army and his opponent's army. Each output should be in seperate
 * line.
 *
 * Solution:
 * A - B problem.
