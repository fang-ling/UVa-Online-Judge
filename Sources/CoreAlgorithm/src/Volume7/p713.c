/*
 * 713 Adding Reversed Numbers
 *
 * The Antique Comedians of Malidinesia prefer comedies to tragedies.
 * Unfortunately, most of the ancient plays are tragedies. Therefore the
 * dramatic advisor of ACM has decided to transfigure some tragedies into
 * comedies. Obviously, this work is very hard because the basic sense of the
 * play must be kept intact, although all the things change to their opposites.
 * For example the numbers: if any number appears in the tragedy, it must be
 * converted to its reversed form before being accepted into the comedy play.
 *
 * Reversed number is a number written in arabic numerals but the order of
 * digits is reversed. The first digit becomes last and vice versa. For example,
 * if the main hero had 1245 strawberries in the tragedy, he has 5421 of them
 * now. Note that all the leading zeros are omitted. That means if the number
 * ends with a zero, the zero is lost by reversing (e.g. 1200 gives 21). Also
 * note that the reversed number never has any trailing zeros.
 *
 * ACM needs to calculate with reversed numbers. Your task is to add two
 * reversed numbers and output their reversed sum. Of course, the result is not
 * unique because any particular number is a reversed form of several numbers
 * (e.g. 21 could be 12, 120 or 1200 before reversing). Thus we must assume that
 * no zeros were lost by reversing (e.g. assume that the original number was
 * 12).
 *
 * Input:
 * The input consists of N cases. The first line of the input contains only
 * positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case consists of exactly one
 * line with two positive integers separated by space. These are the reversed
 * numbers you are to add. Numbers will be at most 200 characters long.
 *
 * Output:
 * For each case, print exactly one line containing only one integer â€” the
 * reversed sum of two reversed numbers. Omit any leading zeros in the output.
 *
 * Solution:
 * Print rev(rev(a) + rev(b)).
