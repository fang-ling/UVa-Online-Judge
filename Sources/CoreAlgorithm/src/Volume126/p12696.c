/*
 * 12696 Cabin Baggage
 *
 * Cabin baggage (also called carry on or hand baggage) is a bag that a
 * passenger is allowed to bring into an aircraft. For safety purpose, cabin
 * baggage must not be too heavy or too big. Every airline company can set its
 * own size and weight limits of cabin baggage according to the IATA
 * (International Air Transport Association) guidelines.
 *   ICPC airline has set the cabin baggage limits as follows:
 *
 *  Cabin baggage should have a maximum length of 56 cm, width of 45 cm and
 * depth of 25 cm or the sum of all 3 sides (length+width+depth) should not
 * exceed 125 cm. Its weight must not exceed 7 kg.
 *
 * The company has a laser measurement device with high precision to evaluate
 * the size and weight of cabin baggage. The device gives 4 values which are
 * positive numbers with 2 decimal points. They are length, width, depth (in cm)
 * and weight (in kg), respectively.
 *
 * For example,
 *   51.23 40.12 21.20 3.45 (this bag is allowed)
 *   60.00 30.00 20.00 7.00 (this bag is allowed)
 *   52.03 41.25 23.50 7.01 (this bag is not allowed)
 * You task is to write a program to check whether or not a cabin baggage is
 * allowed.
 *
 * Input:
 * The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 300) which determines the
 * number of test cases (i.e. cabin baggage to verify). The following t lines
 * contain the measurement of cabin baggage. Each line contains 4 values which
 * are length, width, depth and weight, respectively. All these 4 values are
 * positive numbers with 2 decimal points.
 *
 * Output:
 * For each test case, print out in a line, 1 if it is allowed or 0 otherwise.
 * Finally, print out the total number of the allowed bags in the last line.
 *
 * Solution:
 * Simple branching.
