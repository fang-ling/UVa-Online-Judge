## UVa-Online-Judge

Here are my solutions to some UVa Online Judge problems written in ANSI C.

Tested under:

- UVa Online Judge: 5.3.0 - GNU C Compiler with options: `-lm -lcrypt -O2 -pipe -ansi -DONLINE_JUDGE`
- Local Xcode Workplace: 16.0.0 - Apple clang, Swift Package Manager with `cLanguageStandard = .c89`

Caveat:

- Most of the code reiles the GCC's `__auto_type` extension. `__auto_type` is similar to C++11 `auto` but works in C. This requires GCC 4.9+ or a (at least) late 2015 version of clang. 

Swift codes are only for Xcode unit tests (`xctest`).
